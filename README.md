# SIMKL Context Menu

[![context.simkl](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/thegoddamnbeckster/context.simkl?label=context.simkl)](https://github.com/thegoddamnbeckster/context.simkl/releases/latest) [![SIMKL Scrobbler](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/thegoddamnbeckster/SIMKLScrobbler?label=SIMKL+Scrobbler)](https://github.com/thegoddamnbeckster/SIMKLScrobbler/releases/latest)

**Type:** Kodi Context Menu Addon
**Requires:** script.simkl.scrobbler v7.8.4+

> **Upgrading from context.simkl.rate?** Uninstall that addon first — Kodi treats
> them as different addons because the ID changed.

## Purpose

Adds SIMKL actions to the right-click context menu when browsing movies, TV shows,
seasons, or episodes in Kodi.

## Current Actions

### Rate on SIMKL
Right-click any media item → **Rate on SIMKL**

- Works on movies, TV shows, seasons, and episodes
- Episodes and seasons automatically resolve to their parent show (SIMKL rates shows,
  not individual episodes)
- Delegates to `script.simkl.scrobbler` which shows the 1-10 star rating dialog

## Planned Actions (Backlog)

The following actions are planned for a future release. They will be added as
additional context menu items in this addon — no separate addon required.

### Toggle Watched on SIMKL
Mark or unmark an item as watched on SIMKL directly from the context menu.
Requires `action=togglewatched` to be implemented in `script.simkl.scrobbler`.

### Sync to SIMKL
Trigger a sync of a single item to SIMKL without running a full library sync.
Requires `action=sync` per-item to be implemented in `script.simkl.scrobbler`.

## Installation

1. Install main addon: [script.simkl.scrobbler](https://github.com/thegoddamnbeckster/SIMKLScrobbler/releases/latest) v7.8.4 or higher
2. Download `context.simkl-vX.X.X.zip` from the [Releases](https://github.com/thegoddamnbeckster/context.simkl/releases/latest) page
3. In Kodi, go to **Add-ons > Install from zip file**, navigate to the downloaded ZIP, and install
4. Restart Kodi
5. Right-click any media item → **Rate on SIMKL** appears

## How It Works

This is a **standalone context menu addon** (required by Kodi architecture):
- Detects media type and database ID from the selected item
- For **episodes** and **seasons**: resolves to the parent show via JSON-RPC before delegating
- Calls `script.simkl.scrobbler` with `action=rate` and the resolved type/ID
- Main addon handles authentication, API calls, and the rating dialog

SIMKL supports only movie and show ratings — not individual episodes or seasons.
This addon handles the translation transparently so you always rate the correct entity.

## Technical Details

### Media Type Detection
Uses `ListItem.DBTYPE` instead of `Container.Content()`:
- **DBTYPE**: Works everywhere (library, in progress, recently added, all views)
- **Container.Content**: Only works in main library views

### Episode and Season Resolution
- **Episode**: `GetEpisodeDetails -> tvshowid` -> calls scrobbler with `media_type=show, dbid=<tvshowid>`
- **Season**: `GetSeasonDetails -> tvshowid` -> calls scrobbler with `media_type=show, dbid=<tvshowid>`
- **Movie / Show**: passed through directly, no resolution needed

### Visibility Condition
```xml
String.IsEqual(ListItem.dbtype,movie) |
String.IsEqual(ListItem.dbtype,tvshow) |
String.IsEqual(ListItem.dbtype,season) |
String.IsEqual(ListItem.dbtype,episode)
```
